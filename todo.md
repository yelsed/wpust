### TODO:
- [x] We need to add a version get command.
- [-] I download the new version but it seems that my project still refers to the old version. But i got the new functionalities. (skipped)
- [x] I also want a delete command.
- [x] Why does the update command say this? New release is *NOT* compatible
- [x] We also need to add parameters to the end of the cli call, these need to override the acc. username and password for the commands that use these.
- [x] The description of the goose command should be: Stop it you silly goose.
